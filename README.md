# ROS_Summit_Chassis
Repo containing services scripts and other miscellaneous code for the Summit Autonomous Chassis

## Services
BatteryMonitor_Node_Summit and SummitTwist are meant to be run as services.

## Python Script
SummitCamera contains a text entry field for moving camera servoes and controlling servos on the chassis like the front/rear diffs and shifter and lights.

### TODO
Create a websockets html page that contains the functionality of SummitCamera and turn the script into a ROS node that can run on start.
